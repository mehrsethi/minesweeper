INSTRUCTIONS FOR MINESWEEPER


Quick Start:

You are presented with a board of squares. Some squares contain mines (bombs),
others don't. If you click on a square containing a bomb, you lose. If you manage
 to click all the squares (without clicking on any bombs) you win.
Clicking a square which doesn't have a bomb reveals the number of neighbouring
squares containing bombs. Use this information plus some guess work to avoid the
bombs.
To open a square, point at the square and click on it. To mark a square you think
is a bomb, point and right-click.


Detailed Instructions:

A squares "neighbours" are the squares adjacent above, below, left, right, and all
4 diagonals. Squares on the sides of the board or in a corner have fewer neighbors.
The board does not wrap around the edges.
If you open a square with 0 neighboring bombs, all its neighbors will automatically
open. This can cause a large area to automatically open.
To remove a bomb marker from a square, point at it and right-click again.
Incorrect bomb marking doesn't kill you, but it can lead to mistakes which do.
You don't have to mark all the bombs to win; you just need to open all non-bomb
squares.
Right-clicking twice will give you a question mark symbol which can be useful if
you are unsure about a square.
Click the yellow face to start a new game.


Status Information:

The upper right corner contains the number of bombs left to find. The number will
update as you mark and unmark squares.
The upper left corner contains a time counter.
